# CS226
UCLA Fall 2021 offering of CS 226 (Machine Learning in Bioinformatics), one of the core courses for the Bioinformatics PhD at UCLA.

This offering had 4 problem sets (50% of the grade), with a mix of coding and math problems related to course material. 

We also had one midterm (20%) and one final project (30%).

This repository contains all my work for this class.
